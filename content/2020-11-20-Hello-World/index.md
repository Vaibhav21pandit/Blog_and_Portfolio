Hi and welcome to my blog 📓, In this post I'd like to introduce myself and the blog. I was born and bought up in a tier-3 city in India and did my graduation in Computer Science 👨‍💻 from JIIT Noida. I learned nothing there since I was never presented with a compelling reason for learning something. As Tim Ferris says in his [Foundation Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccFYnEGWoOc) that he only started learning alphabets as a child when his teacher told him that he could read books 📘 if he learned alphabets, I never had any motivation for learning anything about computers.

I got into Deep Learning accidentally while looking for a solution to a project that I had to submit for college assessment and found it super cool that I could segregate pictures 🖼️ based on what object they represented or predict prices of a stock 📈 based on its previous performance. I started  with  Andrew Ng's course but gave up pretty soon due to the heavy calculus 🧮 involved, However 3Blue1Brown and my curiosity came in the way of quitting and I learned a fair amount of calculus without sweating much, all thanks to Grant Sanderson.

**And there came the big lesson, Do not just follow a single course,book or tutorial religiously for learning something. Divide what you want you want to learn into sub modules and then invest a small amount of time figuring out the best resource for each.**

The next thing I'd like to talk about is Computer Vision 👁️‍🗨️, since I'm very biased towards visual learning (which explains my gratitude towards 3Blue1Brown), I like things better when they can be visualized and what's better than images 🖼️ and videos for it, so my inclinations in Applications of Deep Learning is towards Computer Vision and it also explains my interest in mobile-app development 📱. I find math boring without visuals and similarly, code that produces no visuals (Databases and Networking etc) is not my cup of chocolate milkshake 🥤.

That was about my inclinations in software, now onto the blog 📓.

I have been putting off starting my own blog for about 2 years now and would've continued to do so but then I made an account on Twitter a while back and all the brilliant people I'm people following (humble brags about his choice) have strong opinions on why everyone should have their own blog.

Out of all those I liked these three most:

1.) **You are able to document your thought process**- Reflecting upon your thought process gives you an insight into the gaps in your understanding and better insight into how you think. 

2.) **Cement concepts in the brain 🧠**-A quote I read on twitter said-"You don't actually understand something completely until you sit down to write about it.". So to cement the basic concepts of the thing I'm trying to understand, I need to write about it and since I'm writing it, why not put it up on the internet, maybe someone will point out some error in my understanding.

3.) **(Maybe) Help someone out**- There might be someone who's struggling with something I've come across and solved already, so the post may serve as a solution to their problem.

In future I plan to write regularly but my articles won't necessarily be sequential. While I will try to maintain order when writing on a particular topic, I spend time reading about random things and you can expect random articles on these topics. Although I am starting with mostly Computer Vision but you can expect NLP and Audio Processing articles too,  in the future.

Bye, for now.
