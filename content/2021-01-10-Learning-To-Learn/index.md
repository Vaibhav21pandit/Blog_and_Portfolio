excerpt: An article about meta-learning

It was in the 23rd year of my existence on this green & blue planet that I came to know about this concept called meta-learning or "the art of learning to learn" and that has changed the way I look at trying out new things.

Up until that point I had spent my time in competing with my peers and optimizing for a metric that symbolized success in those settings(like coming 1st in a class of 30) but it was when I got my first job, I realized that world does not reward people who optimize for imaginary first place but those who evolve in the workplace and get the job done.

For a person who had learnt to pass exams by pulling an all-nighter before the exams, this was a huge shock, also I had to now change my way of learning new stuff since there was no limit as to what challenge I might be presented with next in the workplace.Before this I used to learn things only by watching youtube and regurgitating what I had seen in those tutorials the next day on a sheet of paper to pass the semester.This was clearly not going to work as there was no exam now and you had to actually make things work to earn a living.

The following are some points that I picked on my way to building a meta-learning algorithm for myself. while this algo stems out of my learnings in learning software, they can be applied to many different things one wants to learn(but apply with caution).So let's dive right in and see what we have in our algo, Also Remember we are looking at techniques to optimize the learning process ie gathering all that's needed in the shortest span of time:

**Learn by building**:Say you want to learn a new framework or a new skill, the most important part of our algo is that you learn your new endeavor by not following books or youtube tutorials but by building something similar of your own.This is necessary if you:

1. don't want to lose interest midway learning that thing
2. actually want to explore the thought process that goes behind building real world things of that kind.

Books and tutorials are fine but they should be compelling enough to keep you engaged no matter how tough the going gets, sadly most books fail at that and also thinking of humans as reinforcement agents, the reward you get after figuring out that one piece of problem that you were stuck on while building something is the exact boost you need to keep learning it, that's something books can't offer.There's a great book 

`Note:` This particular point holds true mostly for learning a new language (programming or otherwise), instead of tirelessly going through books upon books learning the syntax and grammar, start with drawing parallels between the languages you already know and the one you're trying to learn then move on to solving problems i.e solve competitive programming problems or try to talk to a native of that language IRL or on the internet(in case of a spoken language). This is an extension of our **Learn by building** rule where you are building a solution to a real world problem.  ****

**Learn by mimicking**: I know this sounds very counter intuitive to the above point but hear me out, You learn by mimicking stuff that others are doing but not by exactly repeating what they just did, that would make it a cramming chore and you'll end up with no knowledge to apply to a different variation of the task/skill you just learnt.I believe that looking at other people's work that is not exactly the same as you're trying to learn is the second best way to pick up a skill.

**Reference material:** In my opinion most of the tutorials and blog posts aren't the fastest way to learn stuff.Rather you should look for documentation and API references.Start building something and look up the thing you need to build next in your project. With websites like google and stackOverflow there is no problem that you can't solve.

**Observe your gaps around your learning**: If you are finding something hard to grasp, ask yourself which specific thing is the mind not able to retain or understand.We need to observe closely the blockage that hinders our learning flow and solve it.Another great way to overcome this problem is by looking for the solution in different places, although not the best way but iterate fast through different reference materials explaining that blockage point and settle on the best.   



My roadmap for learning a new framework would be:

1. Go to the documentation site and quickly go through the first 5-10 official tutorials 
2. If the documentation has a cookbook, look at some of the recipes that are provided.This is an extension of the Learn by mimicking rule. 
3. start with a project that makes use of the tech I plan to learn, preferably that may have a useful impact on my life and then start building it. Some of the examples to take inspiration from are:
    1. Basic:Handwritten recognition,Wallpaper generator,building twittwr/reddit/discord bots, building a simple website.
    2. Advanced: building your own search engine or your own wiki,your own image manipulation library.
4. Stick with it until you complete the project and remember to learn by mimicking parallely.

So these were the most important insights I gathered from my own discovery of meta-learning.

That's it for this post.

Goodbye, for now ðŸ‘‹.
