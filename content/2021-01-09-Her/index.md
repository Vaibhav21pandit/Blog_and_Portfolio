excerpt: Notes from Spike Jonze's HER
---

**"We've been having a few dozen conversations simultaneously"**

Above is a line taken from the conversation between two Artificial Intelligent OS from the movie HER directed by Spike Jonze, one of my beloved movies and in my opinion the most accurate glimpse of the future there is.The film is set in future, although no account has been given of the year but let's assume the year is 2045. I'm writing this article to document the futuristic pieces of tech and human behavior I noticed in the movie, So let's dive right in.

- The protagonist has a job where he writes letter to people on behalf of his firm's clients so even though Automation is going to leave a lot of stuff that we do today redundant,the director chose a creative profession for the protagonist.
- At  the small airpods looking earphone and the iPod looking PDA are slick, we will need much more speech recognition advances to get at that level where he's traveling on the subway and the earphone can separate his low voice from the noise around and deliver the relevant content.I like how he just deletes things with a single 'Delete'  voice command in a noisy place.
- When he gets bored the protagonist goes to online sexchat rooms where you exist by a fictional name( like reddit usernames) and then search for partners for sexchat or mutual masturbation, shows that as the people get lonelier,they search for partners on the internet than in real life.The coming century will not be a very cozy place for the extroverts with everything decentralized. Another thing is that the other people in the chatrooms can also be AI voices just like GAN generated faces but this time the tech is not just about generation,it's also about answering queries or striking a conversation.
- The epicenter of the movie and a marvelous tech is the OS which goes on to become the protagonist's significant other later on.
- the gesture based Immersive video game(uber cool Mixed reality tech there)
- at 18:54 you see a live wallpaper on the elevator walls that makes it feel like you are going up a twine.It's not futuristic at all but I haven't seen it anywhere yet
- At a point where he says I cant believe I'm having this conversation my computer the OS tries to dodge the topic and change it,they'd want you to think that it's not just an algorithm you're talking to and make it as realistic as possible.
- This OS does not glitch or go wrong even once, laughing at the right time a joke is made,throwing witty compliments, you name it and it does that.Maybe it's because it asks a lot of questions, so many that it seems to be the reason why it's not glitchy.
- At one point the OS asks the protagonist if it can watch him sleep through the night,this kind of data can be really valuable for research.Many facets of research on humans can benefit from the data collected this way.
- The most amazing thing I noticed was the camera in the form of a mole that the surrogate put above her upper lip.Future holds cameras the size of a lice and surveillance is about to go really sneaky.
- At one point Samantha, the OS decides to collect all of the letters written by the protagonist and sends it to a publisher to see if they would publish it,This is astonishing as you are going to have AI cataloguing all your work for you and telling you how to monetize it. Essentially, you're making money off of their intelligence.This is just as [Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman) says we build a superintelligent AI and then ask it how to monetize and run OpenAI
- Hyper intelligent versions of dead people
- Losing an OS is likelier than losing a physical partner.Now your significant other can be dating 8,316 other people and be in love with 641! (watch the movie for the reference)
- Predictionâ€”Just like Industrialization made hand-made things more valuable, the explosion of Generative DL algorithms will make human generated things[letters,novels,dance moves (maybe)] more valuable.
- As the world grows more isolated and societies turn more individualistic, people will bond with other humans less and this creates a void.We can fill this void up with a lot of content generated by both humans and algorithms or we can fill it with digital relationships to make up for the low interactions between people.The company that cracks the second part will be the biggest winner of the present century.

So these were all the points that I believe depict our not-so-near future and the insights I have gathered from them.

That's it for this post.

Goodbye, for now ðŸ‘‹.




<!-- So I've been inactive for a few days and haven't posted anything new which is due to not finding anything interesting to write about but here's a fun toy project that you can tinker with that I made in 2 hours or so.

This is a wallpaper generator made with HTML,CSS and Python.It uses random images taken from the picsum website put together in a collage with HTML and CSS and then the webpage is converted to an image using the htmltoimage API in Python(you can do this in almost any other language too). If you want to dive into the code directly HERE's the link to the repo but please read the instructions about the API below first. I am sure there are better ways to do this but I had this in mind at the time and it was really short and fun so bear with me.

You just need working  knowledge of HTML + CSS and familiarity with python will do.So let's get down to building this now, First we need to get images from picsum website and display them on a webpage for which we are using the <img> tag inside the <div> tag and the source for the img tag should be passed as "https://picsum.photos/200/300?t=1" where a 200x300 dimensional image is fetched from the picsum website and we are specifying an argument "t" so that the different images we fetch are not the same by chance(since it returns random images).I'm using 5 of these images, you can use any number you want just make sure the total width fits the width of the screen.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Wallpaper Generator</title>
    <body>
    <div>
      <div>
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300?t=1">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300?t=2">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300?t=3">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300?t=4">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300?t=7">
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

```

You should see 5 pictures lined up like this in your browser when you run your html file.
<div>
<img src='https://github.com/Vaibhav21pandit/wallpaper-generator/blob/main/screenshot.png?raw=True'>
</div>

\
Next we are going to style our wallpaper by centering the images and putting a margin between the images with the following code.

```css
html,body{
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.container{
  height: 100vh;
  width: auto;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  background-color: rgb(8, 8, 8);
  /* background: linear-gradient( white black); */
}
.pic-ctn{
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

.pic{
  margin: 5px;
}

```
and then we link our corresponding default.css file plus define the classes for the corresponding components like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="imgkit-format" content="png"/>
    <meta name="imgkit-orientation" content="Portrait"/>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <title>Wallpaper Generator</title>
    <meta name="description" content="">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="default.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="pic-ctn">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300?t=1" alt="" class="pic">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300?t=2" alt="" class="pic">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300?t=3" alt="" class="pic">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300?t=4" alt="" class="pic">
        <img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300?t=7" alt="" class="pic">
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

```
\
Now your page should look like this:
\

<div>
<img src='https://github.com/Vaibhav21pandit/wallpaper-generator/blob/main/Wallpaper-1.png?raw=True'>
</div>
\

To change the background color, change the corresponding property in the css file where it says container.

Now it's time to convert the page into image. I tried different approaches for this one was to convert htmlâ†’pdfâ†’ image but that is not a good idea, next I tried using imgkit package, while it just works for the conversion, the image quality is not really the best you can get.

So I went around looking for an alternative and found htmlcsstoimage's website where you can convert the pages to .png or .jpg with help of their developer API.

Head over to the website and create a developer account, in your dash board you will see your User-ID and  API-key, copy them down,create a file and name it keys.json, then store your keys in the following manner.

```json
{
  "user-id":"your_user_id",
  "api-key":"your_api_key"
}

```
now we start with our python code.In the below snippet I have created a function named html_to_image which takes the following arguments:

1. url:the endpoint of htmlcsstoimages website which we want to hit for converting our wallpapers
2. user_id: the user_id value showing in your dashboard
3. api_key: the api_key value showing in your dashboard
4. html_path: the path to your html file
5. css_path: the path to your html file

```py
import requests
import os
import random
import json

def html_to_image(url,user_id,api_key,html_path,css_path):
  with open(html_path,'r') as f:
    html=f.read()
    f.close()

  with open('./default.css','r') as f:
    css=f.read()
    f.close()

  data = { 'html': html,
          'css': css,
          'google_fonts': "Roboto" }

  image = requests.post(url = HCTI_API_ENDPOINT, data = data, auth=(HCTI_API_USER_ID, HCTI_API_KEY))

  print("Your image URL is: %s"%image.json()['url'])

  choice=random.choice(range(0,300,1))

  os.system(f'wget -O ./wallpapers/{choice}.png {image.json()["url"]}')




if __name__=="__main__":
  with open("keys.json","r") as f:
    args=json.load(f)
    print(args["api-key"])
  HCTI_API_ENDPOINT = "https://hcti.io/v1/image"
# Retrieve these from https://htmlcsstoimage.com/dashboard
  HCTI_API_USER_ID = args["user-id"]
  HCTI_API_KEY =args["api-key"]
  html_to_image(url=HCTI_API_ENDPOINT,user_id=HCTI_API_USER_ID,api_key=HCTI_API_KEY,html_path='./index.html',css_path='./default.css')

```

here we are reading data from our html and css files and passing them to a requests function which requests the API for conversion. It returns a url from which we can download our image, next we choose a random integer from 0 to 3000 to name our image file so as to minimize name conflicts(dumb strategy, I know of better solutions but fuck it I like this one for now).Now we use the os.system to execute a bash command to download our file and save it to the directory of our choice.

This downloads our file and we can now use it as our wallpaper. You can also set this up as a cron job and do other cool stuff with this like use it with [Wallch](https://launchpad.net/wallpaper-changer) and update wallpaper periodically.

So that's it for this post.

Goodbye, for now ðŸ‘‹. -->
