excerpt: Update on what's been going on.

Hi all, I have been inactive for a loooooooong time and went AWOL without any explanation or updates, well my life has had it's share of ups and downs during this period where first I lost my job due to COVID then joined another software company where now I do ML with a little bit of NLP, whole family got infected with COVID(everyone's fine though) and I dipped my toes in DeFi and Web3.

So what you can now expect is pretty regular posts, mostly about ML and some Decentralized stuff, I will be looking at the latter from investment perspective and hence little will be covered about the minute details on the tech side.
See you in the next article then,

Goodbye, for now ðŸ‘‹.
