excerpt: Update on what's been going on.

Hi all, I have been inactive for a loooooooong time and went AWOL without any explanation or updates, well my life has had it's share of ups and downs during this period where first I lost my job due to COVID then joined another software company where now I do ML with a little bit of NLP. This role is split up between adding features to a Process insights extraction product and delivering my services for some Fortune 50 clients on the same front. Also last month, my whole family got infected with COVID(everyone's fine though) and now I've started to dip my toes in DeFi and Web3.

So what you can expect from now on, is pretty regular posts, mostly about ML and some Decentralized stuff, I will be looking at the latter from both an investment and a tech perspective and hence will be covering about both aspects of this topic.
See you in the next article then.

Goodbye, for now ðŸ‘‹.
